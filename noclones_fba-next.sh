#########################
#
# This script was made to get, **from your existent romset**, only the ROMs
# that are working and are NOT clones.
#
# Usage: noclones_fba-next /path/to/original/romset /noclone/romset/destination
#
# How the script does it:
# - get the game list (txt file) from libretro fba repository.
# - make another list from the original game list, excluding the clones 
#   (ROMs that has a parent ROM) and the ROMs with a "not OK" flag.
# - from this new list (with good ROMs), copy those that you have in your
#   existing romset and copy to another directory.
#
# I'm pretty sure that clrmamepro and other romset managing tools do a better
# job, but I love to code! :D
